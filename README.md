# WACOMalt's VRCTools
A few scripts to simplify some of the more annoying things VRchat does.

MoveCacheLocation.bat - This lets you move the large cache directories from your C drive to somewhere else using a symlink. Currently hardcoded to move it to D:/Games/VRChat but this will be controllable in a coming update.

EmptyVideoSyncCache.bat - VRChat for some reasons thinks it's necessary to save every video that's ever been played by their videosync panels. That's dumb. And like the previous issue it gets saved to your C drive. This script will simply empty out the cache folder for this.
